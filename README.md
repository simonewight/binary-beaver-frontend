# Your Product Name
> Your Group Name

> [!NOTE]
> This repo has been shared with your group. Use it to develop your group project.
>
> Your group will have received two identical repos - one for your project's back-end, and another for the front-end. Although they are identical right now they are about to diverge, because you'll be using one to create a DRF project and the other to create a React project!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use this `README.md` file to document your MVP using Markdown. Feel free to duplicate the product description aspects between the front-end README and the back-end README, but consider splitting out the technical design aspects to the specific repo that implements them. 
>
> An example MVP spec (containing both front- and back-end descriptions) is set out below - you should replace it with your own content! (Remember to delete any "admonition" blocks like this `IMPORTANT` section, the `CAUTION` and `NOTE` sections, etc.)

> [!CAUTION]  
> In order to set up your project, **one** member of the group should clone this repo down, initialise a new React/DRF project, commit, and push. 
>
> If more than one group member performs the setup, you'll have Git problems. Check out [the Git collaboration content](https://github.com/SheCodesAus/PlusLessonContent?tab=readme-ov-file#26---group-project) for more on how to use Git as a team.

## Technical Implementation

> [!NOTE]  
> What languages and frameworks will you be using? What kind of database will you be using? How will you deploy the website? Example Below.

### Back-End

- Django / DRF API
- Python

### Front-End

- React / JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

### Git & Deployment
- Heroku
- Netlify
- GitHub

This application's back-end will be deployed to Heroku. The front-end will be deployed separately to Netlify.
 
We will also use Insomnia to ensure API endpoints are working smoothly (we will utilise a local and deployed environment in Insomnia).

## Target Audience

> [!NOTE]  
> Who is the website for? (approx 100 words). Example below.

This website has two major target audiences: She Codes 'Leaders, Volunteers & Mentors', and 'She Coders' joining the one-day/short-term workshops. 

**She Codes Leaders, Volunteers and Mentors** (administrators) will use this website to assign one-day workshop coders to specific events and/or collections where they can fill-out a "sticky note" win and paste it on the WinsWall. The administrators will then be able to sort, authorise and delete these stickies and easily download the data in a CSV file. This website is targeted towards this group in order to automate a normally menial task.

**She Coders** (laypeople) will use this website to post their Win on a WinWall board, keep track of what events they've attended and also view previously written wins. This website is targeted to this group in order to prevent loss of paper data (physical sticky notes) and also make the WinsWall more interactive.
